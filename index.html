                <p>
                    Montauk State Park is one of Missouri's Trout parks. It has a vast history
                    as an milling town turned into resort. The park is open all year around, 
                    with regulations differing from season to season. the park is appealing
                    for a day trip, weekend get away, or even longer stays. For a group of friends
                    or a family this is a great place for a retreat.

                <h3> Camping in the park </h3>
                <p>
                    Camping in the park is perfect for both the experienced and new campers.
                    The campsites range from small natural sites, to sites big enough for mobile homes.
                    Some have electric, and all have fire pits and grills for cooking. If camping isnt
                    your thing, they also have a hotel and cabins for rent!

                <h3>Trout Fishing</h3>
                <img src="http://www.naturallyamazing.com/americasparks/18515.jpg">
                <p>
                    Trout fishing is the main attraction of Montauk and for great reasons. Rainbow
                    trout are a fun fish. There are multiple ways to fish for a rainbow trout. The 
                    most popular way to fish for trout is "fly" fishing, where you use "flies" that
                    mimic insects that the trout love. The other popular way to catch the fish is the use
                    of a spinning real and bait.

                <h3> Hiking and wildlife </h3>

                <p>
                    Hiking may appeal to those who do not care to "wet a line". There are small trails
                    that weave through the park and follow the river. The trails are perfect for beginner 
                    hikers as well for family walks. They are easily navigable and require no special equipment.
                    There is also an abundence of wildife to view besides Rainbow trout. You are likely to see
                    deer roaming the park. During certain months of the year you may even be lucky enough to 
                    spot an eagle
